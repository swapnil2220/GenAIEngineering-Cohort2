The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, persona l computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.

NASDAQ_AAPL_2023.pdf,6,2,"f the Company’ s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins . Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’ s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’ s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to of fer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently of fer. Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Com pany’ s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources . The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and acces"
NASDAQ_AAPL_2023.pdf,6,3,"sories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitor s, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufact uring capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concent rate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’ s requirements. The Company has enter ed into agreements for the supply of many components; however , there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.

Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certa in aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.

Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’ s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property , many of the Company’ s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’ s products, processes and services.

Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’ s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer produ ct approaches.

Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally , the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’ s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more comp etitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’ s approach to providing components seamlessly within their of ferings or work collaboratively to of fer integrated solutions. The Compa ny’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases.

The Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’ s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Com pany will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete ef fectively . Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transitio n to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timel y and successful development, "
NASDAQ_AAPL_2023.pdf,10,4,"market acceptance, the Company’ s ability to manage the risks associated with new technol ogies and production ramp-up issue s, the availability of application software for the Company’ s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new produ cts and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical servic es provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’ s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea , Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is curre ntly performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’ s sup"
NASDAQ_AAPL_2023.pdf,10,5,"ply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’ s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Com pany’ s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’ s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition , manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor , environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The Company has inves ted in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements.

Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply , which adversely affected the Company’ s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supp ly of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.

Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely af fect its business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’ s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source . When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’ s requirements.

From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulato ry requirem ents. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how deve lopers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Compan y charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.

For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company , the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’ s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Further , the Company has commercial relations hips with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, "
NASDAQ_AAPL_2023.pdf,17,2,"if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’ s commercial relationships with those business partners and material ly adversely affect the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial cond ition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’ s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. There can be no assurance the Company’ s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Compan y’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’ s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’ s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’ s reputation, loss of "

The Company’ s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal inform ation. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactio ns, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedin gs against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability . In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data.

Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in paymen t card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’ s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

NASDAQ_AAPL_2023.pdf,18,1,"Financial Risks The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Compa ny’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’ s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’ s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressure s and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressu res; increased competition; the Company’ s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’ s services; the Compan y’s ability to manage product quality and warran ty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services,"

These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’ s results of operations and financial condition. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further , the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-tha"

The Company’ s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Compan y’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’ s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely af fected and could in the future be materially adversely af fected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar ’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales. Conversely , a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar , while generally beneficial to the Company’ s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreig n currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally , strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’ s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.

The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’ s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity , credit deteriorat ion, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’ s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially . Therefore , although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’ s results of operations and financial condition.

Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’ s Board of Directors, and the Company’ s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability , dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’ s stock may decline significantly , which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.

For most of the Company’ s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’ s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.

For arrangem ents with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’ s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’ s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Compan y for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, p"

The Company has identified up to three perform ance obligations regularly included in arrangem ents involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-re lated bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks obser"

Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer , which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly , the Company has not recognized revenue, a"

For the sale of third-part y products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer , the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold throug h the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer . Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.® ® Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34"

NASDAQ_AAPL_2023.pdf,54,5,"rinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate beca use of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California November 2, 2023 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51"

Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company’ s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP . The Com pany’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenan ce of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’ s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP , and that the Company’ s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’ s management and dir"

Management, including the Company’ s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’ s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Furthe r, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be consid ered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of f"

Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’ s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrate d Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).
