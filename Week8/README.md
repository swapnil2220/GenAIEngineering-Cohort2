# Week 7: Multimodal AI Systems

This week focuses on understanding and implementing multimodal AI systems that can process and integrate multiple types of data (text, images, and audio).

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how different modalities (text, image, audio) are represented as data
- Learn preprocessing techniques for each modality
- Explore multimodal data integration approaches
- Implement basic multimodal processing pipelines

## Repository Setup

### Clone the GitHub Repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository using Git:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/outskill-git/GenAIEngineering-Cohort2

# Navigate into the repository folder
cd GenAIEngineering-Cohort2/Week7
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

#### For Windows:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### For macOS/Linux:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Requirements

Install the packages listed in requirements.txt:

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verify Installation

Verify that everything is set up correctly:

```bash
# Check installed packages
pip list

# Test numpy import
python -c "import numpy; print('NumPy version:', numpy.__version__)"
```

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Text Modality**: Tokenization, vocabulary mapping, sequence padding
- **Image Modality**: Pixel normalization, resizing, channel handling
- **Audio Modality**: Sample rate conversion, spectral features, windowing
- **Data Standardization**: Preparing multimodal data for AI models
- **Preprocessing Pipelines**: End-to-end data transformation workflows



## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Import Errors**: Make sure you've activated your virtual environment and installed all requirements
2. **Jupyter Not Starting**: Try `pip install --upgrade jupyter` if you encounter issues
3. **NumPy Errors**: Ensure you have a compatible NumPy version with `pip install --upgrade numpy`

### Getting Help:

- Check that your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt)
- Verify all packages are installed with `pip list`
- Restart Jupyter kernel if you encounter runtime errors
